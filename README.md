# Image Compression using React.js

Images draw attention, trigger emotions and improve the user experience of your website. Image compression involves the reduction of the size of your image so that it takes less space on the hard drive and for better search engine optimization when it comes to websites e.g., 2mb to 440kbs. The image still retains its physical properties. We are going to use React to compress our images. 
In this demo we are going to explore how we can achieve this.
